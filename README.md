# Wordle: From Probability To Information Theory
A Wordle solver based on information theory  
## How to Use the Code
- Wordle game
    - Open `wordle_demo.ipynb`, then run code cells in it.
    - Note that you can modify `wd.main()` to `wd.main(seed)`, where `seed` is an integer indicating a random seed, otherwise the program will ask for a seed each time.
- Wordle bot
    - Open`wordle_bot_demo.ipynb`, then run code cells in it.
    - The Algorithm is designed for "Hard Mode" in Wordle. Visit [Wordle official website](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) For more information.
    - Note that first time initialization of the program takes time (~10 minutes).
